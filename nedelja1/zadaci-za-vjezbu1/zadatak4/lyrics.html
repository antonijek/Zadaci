    <h1 id="N1">Spanish Caravan</h1>
    <pre>
    Carry me Caravan take me away
    Take me to Portugal, take me to Spain
    Andalusia with fields full of grain
    I have to see you again and again
    Take me, Spanish Caravan
    Yes, I know you can
    
    Trade winds find Galleons lost in the sea
    I know where treasure is waiting for me
    Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain
    I have to see you again and again
    Take me, Spanish Caravan
    Yes, I know you can</pre

    <h1 id="N2">The Crystal Ship</h1>
    <pre>
      Before you slip into unconsciousness
      I'd like to have another kiss
      Another flashing chance at bliss
      Another kiss, another kiss
      
      The days are bright and filled with pain
      Enclose me in your gentle rain
      The time you ran was too insane
      We'll meet again, we'll meet again
      
      Oh, tell me where your freedom lies
      The streets are fields that never die
      Deliver me from reasons why
      You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly
      
      The crystal ship is being filled
      A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
      A million ways to spend your time
      When we get back, I'll drop a line</pre

    <h1 id="N3">End Of The Night</h1>
    <pre>
        Take the highway to the end of the night
        End of the night, end of the night
        Take a journey to the bright midnight
        End of the night, end of the night
        
        Realms of bliss, realms of light
        Some are born to sweet delight
        Some are born to sweet delight
        Some are born to the endless night
        End of the night, end of the night
        End of the night, end of the night
        
        Realms of bliss, realms of light
        Some are born to sweet delight
        Some are born to sweet delight
        Some are born to the endless night
        End of the night, end of the night
        End of the night, end of the night</pre

    <h1 id="N4">People Are Strange</h1>
    <pre>
        People are strange when you're a stranger
        Faces look ugly when you're alone
        Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
        Streets are uneven when you're down
        
        When you're strange
        Faces come out of the rain
        When you're strange
        No one remembers your name
        When you're strange
        When you're strange
        When you're strange
        
        People are strange when you're a stranger
        Faces look ugly when you're alone

        When you're strange

        When you're strange
        When you're strange

    <pre>
        Riders on the storm
        Riders on the storm
        Into this house we're born
        Into this world we're thrown
        Like a dog without a bone
        An actor out on loan
        Riders on the storm
        
        There's a killer on the road
        His brain is squirmin' like a toad
        Take a long holiday
        Let your children play
        If you give this man a ride
        Sweet family will die
        Killer on the road, yeah
        
        Girl, you gotta love your man
        Girl, you gotta love your man
        Take him by the hand
        Make him understand
        The world on you depends
        Our life will never end
        Gotta love your man, yeah
        
        Riders on the storm
        Riders on the storm
        Into this house we're born
        Into this world we're thrown
        Like a dog without a bone
        An actor out on loan.
