            In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe is a
            quadriplegic millionaire who is interviewing candidates for the
            position of his carer, with his red-haired secretary Magalie. Out of
            the blue, Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document
            from the Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign it to prove that
            he is seeking a job position so he can receive his unemployment
            benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a trial period of
            one month to gain experience helping him. Then Driss can decide
            whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the
            challenge and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of
            Phillipe and his employees

            The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia
            family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's wedding.
            Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also
            present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a
            part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to
            all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do
            not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs
            and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.
            What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new
            ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant
            in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families
            which could tear the Corleone family apart.

            an unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he

            the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100
            Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a
            testament to the good in all of us.

            to people and meets the president several times. However, this is

            sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the
            end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.

            After his death sometime in his 43rd year, suburbanite Lester
            Burnham tells of the last few weeks of his life, during which he had
            no idea of his imminent passing. He is a husband to real estate
            agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane
            Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now
            merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both
            her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home
            life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn,
            relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the
            persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the
            professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate
            business in their neighborhood.
